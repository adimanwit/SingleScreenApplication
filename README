Content Review

Your design must include:

- Business name
- At least one photo representing the business
- Two or more other pieces of information, such as:
- Contact information for the business (eg phone number, email address, website)
- Address of the Business
- Description of business
- Hours of operation

Excellent work -- your layout contains all the required info as well as a photo representing the business.
